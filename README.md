hidmacros ( my verson - the forked one )
=========
This was built for XPlane, I don't do a lot of flight sim stuff right now.
I will come back to it in the future and may decide to updaate that stuff,
but it's not right now. If you wanna contribute feel free. I'm not the original
maker, but he stepped away quite a while ago now. And I felt the need to become
the macro king, so I downloaded and the UI looks old so I might tweak if you know.
